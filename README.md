# learn-github

#  Hi there!  

I'm just starting my journey in programming and learning how to use GitHub to share my work and collaborate with others. This space is where I'll document my progress, explore new ideas, and grow as a developer.  

## Current Focus  
- Understanding the basics of programming  
- Exploring web development and simple projects  
- Learning how to use Git and GitHub effectively  

## Why I'm Here  
I believe that learning by doing is the best way to grow. GitHub is not just a platform for me—it's a place to experiment, learn from others, and improve my skills step by step.  

Feel free to explore my repositories as I build and learn. If you have tips or beginner-friendly advice, I’d love to hear from you!
